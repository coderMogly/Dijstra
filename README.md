#Dijstra
This code implements graph class and performs Dijstra's shortest path algorithm to calculate the minimum cost path. 

vertex: node in a graph represented by an integer.

Edge: edge of a graph.

closed set: set of graph vertices to whom minimum path is already found. 

open set: set of graph vertices that can be reached form already traversed graph. They are arranged in the assending order of cost.

operator.cpp : contains the operator overloading for vertices and edges

Feel free to use it as you like.
